# Advanced-MIPS---Lab-9
This lab is a part of my CS233 class (Computer Architecture). Here, I implemented MIPS in a more advanced way - I used recursion, and function calling conventions. I also managed large data structures and pointers using MIPS assembly. 

The overall goal of this project was to develop code using MIPS that could eventually solve a given puzzle.
